#Pass additional parameters to certain steps of the pipeline. 
#Cutadapt is used in adapter trimming.
#Star is for alignment, recommended parameters are set.
#The parameters necessary to run the pipeline are coded within the pipeline and
#cannot be changed. These parameters are:
#--outSAMunmapped Within KeepPairs --quantMode TranscriptomeSAM --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted
#Bams are sorted by using samtools sort independently for star, which is identical to "--outSAMtype SortedByCoordinate" star parameter
#Rsem is used for counts, recommended parameters are set.
#The parameters necessary to run the pipeline are coded within the pipeline and
#cannot be changed. These parameters are:
#--bam
#Rsem seed is set randomly by the system, and strandedness is set from units.tsv file
