AmbiguousRuleException:
Rules deseq2 and deseq2_TE are ambiguous for the file results/diffexp/TE/treated-vs-untreated.diffexp.tsv.
Consider starting rule output with a unique prefix, constrain your wildcards, or use the ruleorder directive.
Wildcards:
	deseq2: contrast=TE/treated-vs-untreated
	deseq2_TE: contrast=treated-vs-untreated
Expected input files:
	deseq2: results/deseq2/all.rds
