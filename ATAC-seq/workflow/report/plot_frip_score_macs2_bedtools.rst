**Genrich FRiP score** is generated by calculating the fraction of all mapped reads that fall into the `Genrich <https://github.com/jsh58/Genrich>`_ called narrow peak regions.
A read must overlap a peak by at least 20% to be counted to `FRiP score <https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/>`_.
